# XYZ Reader

This is a mock RSS reader for Project #5 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

The starting point for this is a functional app that needs a UI overhaul. The goal of the project is to improve the 
UI and user experience.

All changes and improvements are implemented following the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/)
